# Pooplang
Pooplang is a Lua library that makes writing code weird and fun!

## Usage
`poop_text(text)` to print text

`set_pooparle(name, val)` to define a variable

`add/subtract/divide/multiply_poop(poopA, poopB)`

`check_if_poop(condition)` an if statement

`poop_times(times)` print "Poopy poop" to the screen

## Using pooparles and checking if poop

### Pooparles (example):

```
set_pooparle("PooparleA", 3)
poop_text(pooparles["PooparleA"])
```

### Checking if poop (example)

```lua
if check_if_poop(3 + 2 == 5) then
    poop_text("Poop!")
end
```
